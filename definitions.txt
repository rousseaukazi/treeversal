# Future Treeversal Application - Definitions

## Core Concepts

**Future Treeversal**: The entire process of navigating through decision trees to explore potential futures based on probabilistic outcomes.

**Node**: Each decision point in the tree where the user is presented with multiple possible futures. Nodes are numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.).

**Paths**: The 5 potential futures presented at each node. These represent different probabilistic outcomes following a normal distribution:
- Path options alternate between letters [a, b, c, d, e] and numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Distribution: small % hyper conservative, large % middle-of-road, small % hyper aggressive

**Treeversal**: The final alphanumeric string representing the complete path taken through the decision tree (e.g., "a3c1b" would represent the sequence of choices made).

## Application Flow

1. Start at Node 1
2. Present 5 paths labeled [a, b, c, d, e]
3. User selects one letter
4. Move to next level, present 5 paths labeled [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5. User selects one number
6. Continue alternating between letters and numbers
7. Track the complete path as the Treeversal string

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Each node alternates between letter choices (a-e) and number choices (1-5)
- The Treeversal string grows with each selection
- Users can trace back their decisions using the final Treeversal string
